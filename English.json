Stomt is a service of the firm Stomt GmbH based in Germany. By making contact a query is posted on a public Community Board hosted and operated by Stomt GmbH. Among other options, registered users can reply there as well. However, the message can also be composed in such a way that it is posted anonymously. An email address and a user name can but do not have to be made available. The same applies for a screenshot of the respective game scene in which the problem arises. If you use this service, Stomt processes the posted data on its own behalf and under its own responsibility on the basis of its privacy policy at https://www.stomt.com/privacy.\nBesides this data, which we have no influence upon, we receive technical data intended to help us in solving any technical issues. Insofar as an email address is indicated, we receive the following data together with said email address and the user name indicated:\n\\u2022 Screen Resolution\n\\u2022 Version of the game\n\\u2022 Information whether the gamer is in an ongoing game or in the main menu\n\\u2022 Details about the existing hardware and operation system, including drivers\n\\u2022 Time elapsed, in seconds, since the game was started\n\\u2022 Replay – data that contains the game moves made until now\n\\u2022 Logfile of the game with possible error warnings, including the following data:\n    \\u2022 IP adress of the local network (not the Internet IP)\n    \\u2022 Computer name\n    \\u2022 Unity version\n\\u2022 A text file containing all information about the game map created by the gamer and all starting options selected\nThis data is stored at Stomt and made availble to us and/or software developers commissioned by us.\nThe software developer commissioned by us shall reply to customer queries via email or on the Stomt platform. In the event of a reply via email, the entire follow-up email correspondence shall be saved."

The data are collected directly by Stomt, however the transmission of data to Stomt occurs only when you actively send a “Stomt” message. Data that are not published are processed by Stomt on our behalf pursuant to Art. 28 para 3 of the GDPR.\nThe legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para 1 (f) of the GDPR therefore lies in the functionality of our game and the customer service for customers with whom we maintain no direct contractual relationship.\nThe developer of software commissioned by us processes support queries on our behalf pursuant to Art. 28 para. 3 of the GDPR, and solely within the European Union. In addition, the legitimate interest for email storage here is that we want to monitor the customer service provided by our developer in terms of its quality."
